Find the distance between consecutive steps
Find the distance between every two steps
Use the cosine rule arcos((leg1^2+leg2^2-hypot^2)/(2*leg1*leg2)) to calculate turns
OUTPUT: The average turn angle

Convert distances between consecutive steps to mm/min (*60/12.2)
OUTPUT: The number of times they stop (distance between consecutive step <25mm/min).

Allow customization of stopping threshold.
